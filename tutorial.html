Press Shift-Q again to exit "Quick Select"<a href="http://imgur.com/YYeRhnv"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/YYeRhnv.png" title="Hosted by imgur.com"/></a>

                <img src="http://i.imgur.com/5AM7kU6.png" title="Hosted by imgur.com" width="150" height="200"><h2>3.</h2>Copy the selected area, and paste it in as a new layer. Then drag the area to the correct position.

                <h2>4.</h2>Open the Channels dialog in the Layers - Brushes window, and deselect and turn off two of the colors, but leave Alpha on. Go to Colors, and enter the Levels adjustment.

                <img src="http://i.imgur.com/lFs4B91.png" title="Hosted by imgur.com" width="150" height="200"><h2>5.</h2>This is where the magic happens. Adjust the sliders to bring out as much detail as you can, while still maintaining resolution. Good rule of thumb is to keep the two sliders on the ends at each end of the "mountain" and slide the middle one a bit around to get brigness. Idealy you want to get each color to come as close to the skin-color as possible, as that will make it easier later on.

                <img src="http://i.imgur.com/jMrmRg7.png" title="Hosted by imgur.com" width="150" height="200"><h2>6.</h2>When you have done this to all three colors you probably need to adjust the hue. So enter the Colors - Color Balance with all three color-channels selected, and move the sliders gently around to match skintone. This is done on Shadows, Midtone and Highlights. Go back and forth on all three to ajust as close as possible. It helps to occasionally click OK and re-enter in to Color Balance to adjust more closely.

                <img src="http://i.imgur.com/ZGy4pKK.png" title="Hosted by imgur.com" width="150" height="200"><h2>7.</h2>Some final adjustments are in order, and now we bring out the Dodge/Burn tool. With this we can darker the needed areas (some shadows, and also the areola around the nipple needs to darken) and also lighten to bring out more shape. This step takes some practice to get the hang of. One good tip is to use very low Exposure on the tool and a very soft brush. That way you won't get too many hard edges.
